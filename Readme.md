# **bTB-forestry**

`bTB-forestry` is APHAs nextflow pipeline for analysing phyolgenies and snp-matrices for bovine TB, on a clade-by-clade basis.  It is inteneded as a follow on process to [btb-seq](https://github.com/APHA-CSU/btb-seq)  and has been specifically designed around the outputs (summary csv and directory structure) from that pipeline.
